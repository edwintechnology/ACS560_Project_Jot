To download and run the project:

Download the jot folder.  Make sure that you grab everything that is included in the folder

Now when you run it make sure that you open the file "/jot/mobile/index.html"

if you are running under linux just use firefox "/jot/mobile/index.html"


there client side is simple for the webpage.

for android/ios is a little bit more tricky..

if you do not have android installed and would like it for your own computer follow
this tutorial for getting started with android. http://edwintechnologyfw.blogspot.com/2013/11/getting-started-with-android.html

when you have it installed, just import the folder called "Jot" that is inside the jot folder
this will have the sources for the android application and you can run it from eclipse or the command line
depending on which way that you install android

the IOS, if you have xcodes (or a mac) you just just open the sources and run the application
with the simulator as is.
